        <ol class="steps">
         <li> 
            
            <h4>Preparation</h4>
            1. Soak 18 to 20 cashews in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.<br/>
            
            cashews getting soaked in hot water to make paneer butter masala gravy <br/>
            2. While the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients. It’s time for chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the ginger-garlic paste, and slicing paneer into cubes.<br/>
            
            tomatoes, green chillies, ginger, garlic chopped on a white board<br/>
            3. To make the ginger garlic paste, crush a 1 inch piece of peeled ginger with 3 to 4 small to medium-sized garlic cloves in a mortar & pestle. Continue crushing until it is a semi-fine or fine paste. Keep aside.<br/>
            
            <b>Note: Don’t add any water while crushing ginger & garlic.</b><br/>
            
            ginger and garlic crushed in a mortar-pestle<br/>
            4. After 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and add the soaked cashews to a blender or mixer-grinder.<br/>
            
            Also, add 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh water (or as much as is required to blend to a fine paste).<br/>
            
            soaked cashews and water added in a blender jar<br/>
            5. Blend to a smooth paste without any tiny bits or chunks of cashews. Remove the cashew paste from the blender and set it aside.<br/>
            
            cashews ground to a smooth paste for making paneer butter masala recipe<br/>
            6. In the same blender, add 2 cups of diced or roughly chopped tomatoes.<br/>
            
            Note: There’s no need to blanch the tomatoes or to wash the blender pitcher before blending.<br/>
            
            chopped tomatoes added in the same blender jar<br/>
            7. Blend to a smooth tomato puree. Set aside.<br/>
            
            <b>Note: Don’t add any water while blending the tomatoes.</b><br/>
            
            tomatoes blended to a smooth purée to make paneer butter masala gravy<br/>
            <h4>Make Tomato Gravy</h4><br/>
            8. Heat a thick bottomed pan or a heavy pan. Keep the heat to a low or medium-low. Add 2 tablespoons (or 3 to 4 tablespoons for a richer version) butter in a pan. Either salted or unsalted butter can be used.<br/>
            
            <b>Tip: Alternatively, you can add 1 tablespoon oil + 1-2 tablespoons of butter to the pan. Adding oil prevents the butter from browning too quickly.</b><br/>
            
            butter getting melted in a pan<br/>
            9. Keep the the heat to a low. Add 1 medium-sized tej patta and fry for 2 to 3 seconds, or until fragrant.<br/>
            
            tej patta getting fried in butter<br/>
            10. Add the prepared crushed ginger-garlic or 1 teaspoon ready-made ginger-garlic paste.<br/>
            
            crushed ginger-garlic paste added to pan<br/>
            11. Sauté until the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic disappears, about 10 to 12 seconds.<br/>
            
            frying ginger-garlic paste<br/>
            12. Pour in the prepared tomato purée.<br/>
            
          <b>  Note: Be careful while adding the purée as it may splutter.</b><br/>
            
            tomato purée added to pan to make paneer butter masala gravy<br/>
            13. Mix it very well with the butter.<br/>
            
            tomato purée mixed with flavored oil<br/>
            14. Begin to cook the tomato purée on a low to medium-low heat. Stir at intervals.<br/>

            15. The tomato purée mixture will start simmering.<br/>
            
            tomato purée simmering in the pan<br/>
            16. If the tomato purée splutters too much while cooking, then cover the pan partly with a lid or cover fully with a splatter guard (channi lid).<br/>
            
            splatter lid kept on the pan<br/>
            17. Continue stirring occasionally.<br/>
            
            stirring tomato purée<br/>
            18. Simmer the purée for 5 to 6 minutes.<br/>
            
            simmering tomato purée<br/>
            19. Add 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder or deghi mirch.<br/>
            
            You can also opt to add just ½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder, or ¼ – ½ teaspoon of cayenne, paprika or any other variety of red chilli powder that you prefer.<br/>
            
            kashmiri red chilli powder being added<br/>
            20. Mix well and continue to stir and sauté the tomato purée.<br/>
            
            kashmiri red chilli powder mixed with the puree<br/>
            21. Sauté till the butter starts leaving the sides of the pan and the entire tomato purée mixture comes together as more of a thick paste.<br/>
            
           <b> Note: This entire cooking/sautéing process takes about 14 to 17 minutes on a low to medium-low heat. Time will vary depending on the thickness of the pan, size, the intensity of flame etc.</b><br/>
            
            tomato purée thickened and cooked very well for paneer butter masala recipe<br/>
            Add Cashew Paste<br/>
            22. Now add the prepared cashew paste.<br/>
            
            cashew paste added<br/>
            23. Mix the cashew paste very well with the cooked tomato puree and continue to stir and sauté on a low to medium-low heat.<br/>
            
            After adding cashew paste, be sure to continuously stir the gravy.<br/>
            
            cashew paste mixed with the tomato purée
            24. Sauté until the cashew paste is cooked and the oil begins to leave the sides of the masala. The cashew will cook quickly, just around 3 to 4 minutes on a low heat. And don’t forget to keep on stirring non-stop!<br/>
            
            sautéing the entire mixture<br/>
            25. Next add 1.5 cups water.<br/>
            
            water added to tomato gravy<br/>
            Assemble Paneer Butter Masala.<br/>
            26. Mix the water very well with the tomato-cashew masala. If there are lumps, then break them with a spoon or use a wired whisk for mixing.<br/>
            
            water mixed evenly to make paneer butter masala gravy<br/>
            27. Let the curry simmer and come to a boil on a low to medium-low heat. Stir occasionally.<br/>
            
            paneer butter masala gravy simmering<br/>
            28. After 2 to 3 mins, add ginger julienne (about 1-inch ginger – cut in thin, matchstick-like strips). Reserve a few for garnishing. The curry will begin to thicken.<br/>
            
            ginger julienne added<br/>
            29. After 3 to 4 minutes, add 1 or 2 slit green chiles.<br/>
            
            slit green chillies added to gravy<br/>
            30. Also add salt to taste and, if necessary, ¼ to 1 teaspoon sugar depending on the sourness of the tomatoes.<br/>
            
            Tip: If you add cream, then you will need to add less sugar. You can also opt to omit sugar entirely if you prefer.<br/>
            
            sugar and salt added<br/>
            31. Mix very well and simmer for a minute.<br/>
            
            gravy mixed very well<br/>
            32. After the gravy thickens to your desired consistency, then add the paneer cubes (200 or 250 grams).<br/>
            
            Tip: Keep in mind the consistency you want before you add paneer, as you will be cooking the paneer for just a few seconds, until it is warmed through. You can also fry the paneer and then add it once the gravy is to your liking.<br/>
            
            paneer cubes added to makhani gravy<br/>
            33. Stir and mix the paneer cubes gently in the gravy. You can switch off the heat at this point.<br/>
            
            Tip: If your paneer still tastes raw at this point, leave the heat on low until after you add the cream in step 35.<br/>
            
            paneer cubes mixed in the gravy<br/>
            34. Now quickly add 1 teaspoon crushed dry fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi leaves) and 1 teaspoon garam masala to the gravy.<br/>
            
           <b> Note: The addition of crushed dry fenugreek leaves gives a restaurant flavor to this curry, but it is optional and can be skipped.</b><br/>
            
            garam masala powder and crushed kasuri methi leaves added<br/>
            35. Next add 2 to 3 tablespoons of low-fat or light cream or 1 to 2 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream.<br/>
            
            cream added<br/>
            36. Stir gently but well. If you haven’t yet, switch off the heat.<br/>
            
            cream mixed evenly and paneer butter masala ready to be served<br/>
            37. Serve Paneer Butter Masala hot garnished with 1 to 2 tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) and the remaining ginger julienne. You can also drizzle some cream or dot with butter while serving. <i><b>Enjoy!</b></i><br/>
