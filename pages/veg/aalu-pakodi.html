<b>INGREDIENTS FOR ALOO PAKORA</b>
<h5>Gram Flour :<br/></h5>
The batter is typically made using Gram Flour, but other flours, such as buckwheat flour, can be used in variations. Spices used in the batter are up to the cook and may be based on local tradition or availability; fresh and dried spices like as chilli, fenugreek, and coriander are frequently used.<br/>

<h5>Corn Flour :<br/> </h5>
In the same way as Gram Flour binds two things together, cornflour does as well. It's also a fantastic thickener. In practically any recipe, cornflour can be used in place of gramme flour. It's a tad too dense, though, for meals like Pakoras or Cheela.<br/>

<h5>Chat Masala Powder:<br/></h5>
Chaat Masala has a distinct flavour that is easy to recognise. It's a sophisticated blend of acidic, spicy, salty, tangy, and sour with a tinge of sweetness, in my opinion.<br/>

Here are three simple steps to making the ideal batch of crispy and flavorful pakoras<br/>

Lumps in the batter should be avoided.<br/>
Drain the Veggies of any excess water.<br/>
Maintain the oil is temperature.<br/>
