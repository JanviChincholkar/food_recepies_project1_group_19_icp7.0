    1. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes.  <br>
        Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.   <br>
       2. Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden.  <br> 
       3. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.  <br>
        Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp.   <br>
       4. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.  <br>
        Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking.
       5. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.  <br>
        Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.  <br>
       6. Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. <br>
       7. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices. <br>
       8. Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil. <br>
       9. Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring. <br>
        Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.
