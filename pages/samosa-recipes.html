1.Mixing the oil with flour is important rub it for good 3 to 4 minutes
do so by rubbing between your hands until the oil is well incorporated with the flour.</br>
 2.Dont overwork the dough you only need to bring the dough together
If you overwork it, the samosa will be hard.</br>
3.Dough should be stift soft dough will not give crispy samosa
Let the dough rest for around 40 minutes always remember to let the dough rest.</br>
4.for at least 30 to 40 minutes before you start making the samosa.</br>
5.Roll the dough evenly and roll it thin try to roll the dough thin and evenly.</br>
6.If the dough is rolled thick, it will take a long time for the dough to get cooked.</br>
Also we all like thin crispy edges of the samosa, agree?
7.But dont roll it super thin too, else the dough will tear apart when you fill it.</br>
8.Do not use any flour while rolling the samosa, you can apply little oil on your rolling pin.</br>
9.Fry the samosa on low heat  the most important thing- always fry the samosa on low heat 
(not high, not medium), that way they will turn crisp.</br>
