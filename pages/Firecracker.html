1.Combine hot pepper flakes, hot pepper paste, soy sauce, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, ground black pepper, rice syrup, garlic, and ginger in a bowl.  <br>
2.Mix it well into a sweet and spicy paste. <br>
3.Add the chicken and mix well by hand <br>
4.Heat up a skillet with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Add the sliced rice cakes and fry them for a few minutes.  <br>
5.Turn them over with a spatula once or twice until both sides are crispy and light golden brown. <br>
6.Place the marinated chicken into a heavy pan, preferably cast iron. Use the water to rinse the bowl and get the last of the sauce into the pan. <br> 
7.Cover and cook over medium high heat for 10 minutes. If you use a normal frying pan, it will take 7 to 8 minutes. Be sure not to burn the chicken. <br>
8.Uncover, stir and turn over the chicken with a wooden spoon. Add the rice cakes to the top of the chicken. <br>
9.Turn down the heat very low. Cover and let cook another 10 minutes, until the chicken is fully cooked. If you’re using cheese, pre-heat the oven broiler. <br>
10.When the chicken is cooked, put the cheese over the top. Slip it into the oven for a few minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly. <br>
11.Remove and sprinkle with the chopped green onion. Serve hot.
